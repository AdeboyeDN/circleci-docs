## Changes
{: #changes }

There are many changes between Ubuntu 14.04 and 20.04 that you should be aware of before migrating.
Many are changes that Canonical has made (the company behind Ubuntu), but also changes that CircleCI has made to the software that we pre-install.
Let's go through each of these changes separately.
