{{/* This shortcode replicates jekyll's site.baseurl feature
     This way we can get the root url which is required for linking files and images

     NOTE: normally, .Page.Site.BaseURL returns the site url with a trailing forward "/"
     whereas the way we used Jekyll required writing the "/" whenever using site.baseurl.
     So, rater than find and replace every "/" and possibly miss somethin during the migration
     I've just set this shortcode to trim the trailing slash.
